install
-------

[bpkg](https://github.com/bpkg/bpkg)

$ bpkg install -g benkogan/weather.sh
```

source:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/benkogan/weather.sh.git
$ make install -C weather/
```

usage
-----

```
usage: weather [-chV] [-CF]

[-c|--cached]      uses a cache
[-h|--help]        help and usage
[-V|--verison]     version

[-C|--celsius]     check in Celcius
[-F|--fahrenheit]  check in Fahrenheit (default behavior)
```

If provided no arguments, weather.sh will check in Fahrenheit. The `-F` flag exists for the sake of symmetry.

The cached option creates a cache file to store the current weather. Within the time boundaries of modnew and modold (set within the script), `weather.sh` will load from the cache instead of from Yahoo Weather. This can be useful in various situations. For example, weather.sh can be used to display the weather in your [tmux][t] status bar (I like to do so using [tmuxline.vim][tl]). By default, tmux's status interval is 15 seconds, and so weather.sh will attempt to update at an unnecessarily-frequent rate. Instead of setting a slow status interval to avoid such waste, enable caching with `-c`!
